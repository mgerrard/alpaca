In case you need to debug within the container, and have some
files in a current directory to test out:

1. Comment out the last line in Dockerfile and rebuild
by running: 
 sudo docker build -t portfolio .

2. Drop into the container by running:
 docker run --privileged -it -v ${PWD}:/home/alpaca_logs \
   -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw portfolio /bin/bash
